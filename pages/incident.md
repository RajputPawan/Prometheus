If you have issues that a functionality does not work as expected or as documented you should create a incident ticket.

Having incident tickets is important as this is one of the main measures for the SLA of the Ubuntu provider. The biggest measure  besides resolution time is the survey and the Customer Satisfaction / Dissatisfaction. So please answer the survey and answer honestly how you feel. (5 Star rating.)
