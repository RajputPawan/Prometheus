## Reinstall System via reinstall-os

Using the reinstall-os.sh script, makes it possible to reinstall, upgrade or downgrade the Ubuntu system which is installed on your client machine,without using a boot device and without Onsite support.


:bangbang: **PLEASE BE AWARE, THAT DURING THE REINSTALLATION ALL DATA ON YOUR CLIENT DEVICE WILL BE COMPLETELY ERASED!** Make sure you have backups of all your important data, if you want to use this script! :bangbang:

The reinstall-os.sh script won't start if:

After the script has been successfully loaded, a window will occur. You have the following options:
