## How to join the beta (INT) for our environment

Changes are tested in the INT environment and applied to the production
environment once they have been confirmed to work.

If you are an __experienced Linux user__ and willing to take the risk of
occasional bugs and breakages while being the first to evaluate and give
feedback on configuration changes, follow this guide.

### Benefits

* Be part of the community.
* Help by testing changes and suggesting improvements.
* Daily (instead of monthly) patches.

### Risks

__Warning__: _If you are not ready to occasionally spend some time  to
help investigate problems, test changes and look deeper into your Linux
system, this is probably not for you!_

### OK, I am ready

Write to mbox-059-ubuntu-operations (059-NPM)
<ubuntu-operations@mercedes-benz.com> and ask to be assigned the INT
configuration.

If you want to go back to the stable environment, also send a mail to the above
address.
