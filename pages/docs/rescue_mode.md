### About

The Rescue mode was designed to provide remote support if the main operating system is not bootable anymore.

Or has another issue which prevent remote support.

The host must be connected to Mercedes Benz internal network to get a IP address from the range 53.


### Procedure

You can start the rescue mode by choosing it from Ubuntu boot menu (shown in picture #1).

After the rescue mode was started, please provide the IP address, which is shown on screen, to the Ubuntu Support.

We can not provide any support if you are not in Mercedes Benz internal network and the IP is not starting with 53.

If the rescue mode was started by mistake simply shutdown and restart the machine.
