## AD Self Service

The AD Self Service Portal is avaialble under https://adselfservice.app.corpintra.net/WEbGM/
In case the group you'd like to change was newly created, please re-login to Windows first.

Either enter a group name at 1, or just clock "I am assigned as group owner" and click "Search" to list all groups owned by you.
Then, click "Manage" next to the group you'd like to manage (see 2)

![ad-self-service-2](images/docs/ad-self-service/ad-self-service-2.png)

On the next screen, you can either search for an account (see 1), or "quick add" or "quick remove" groups if you already know the exact AD account name (see 2). Then, click "Next". (see 3)

On the last screen you can see a summary of what is being done (see 1), you can optionally notify the group members or the owner (likely yourself) of the changes (see 2), and as a last step you need to click the "Apply" button. (see 3). 

That's it :-)
