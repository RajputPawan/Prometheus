Pidgin with Sipe can be configured using the setup script `/usr/local/bin/pidgin-sipe-setup`. Find more info on the [Pidgin-Sipe docu page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/docs/pidgin-sipe.md %}).

## Pidgin Sipe

We have rolled out Pidgin with the Sipe plugin.

This open source solution has proven to be a reliable replacement for Sky where we have run out of valid licenses and where facing crashes. Even screen sharing is supported.
