If you are using GNOME Evolution as email client on Ubuntu, we would invite you
to [renew your access permissions in Alice](
/ubunturd/ubuntudoc/evolution.html#request-ubuntuusers-role-in-alice)
because in a few weeks, the old access permission will stop working.

The process is automated and you can select the role to be valid indefinitely.
