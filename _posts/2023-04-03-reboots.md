Client systems running Microsoft Windows are getting rebooted at least once a week. A similar behaviour will be gradually adopted to the Ubuntu RD Client environment. 

Currently it is planned to **enforce** a reboot if a machine has an **uptime of 30 days** or more, starting from May. This frequency might be reduced after additional announcements. Regularily rebooting machines is crucial to make sure that fixes to core components of the OS are getting applied, especially after receiving updated kernel packages.

Machines that are rebooted **at least once a month** will not encounter any difference to the current behaviour.
