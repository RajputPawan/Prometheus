On Jan 23 2020 the Ubuntu repo server had limited reachability. This was caused by a faulty network in the VMware backend infrastructure. 

Impact was slow downloads of packages or timeouts that broke installations or updates.

Moving the virtual machine to another server solved the problem and service was restored on Jan 23 afternoon.
