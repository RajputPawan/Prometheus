Currently there persists a problem that the proxy.pac file is not delivered constantly. Information Security Office RD is working on having that fixed.

As px-proxy does not cache pac-file this results in connection issues with cli tools and other tools that use local forwarding proxy (ms-teams)

We implemented a workaround with a local pac-file

This change should arrive within the next 30min to your systems. To force config immediately you could run

```bash
sudo salt-call state.highstate -l info
```

if you have sudo on your system

after that change was applied you still need either to reboot or restart your px-proxy user service:

```bash
systemctl --user restart px-proxy
```
