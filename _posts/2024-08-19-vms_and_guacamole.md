Today we unveil two new solutions:

1. [Managed virtual Ubuntu clients in the data center.](
   /ubunturd/ubuntudoc/fpp.html) You can tell us your requirements in a service
   request and get graphical or only SSH (console) access. Systems are hosted on
   [FPP](https://social.cloud.corpintra.net/groups/devops-community/blog/2019/07/10/how-to-use-faster-provisioning-portalfpp)
   as backend but are not time bound.
2. To access your new datacenter VM or also an existing workstation,
   [Use our new "Guacamole" remote desktop portal.](
   /ubunturd/ubuntudoc/guacamole.html)

does not work as intended, this might be an alternative for users needing
Linux for their projects.
