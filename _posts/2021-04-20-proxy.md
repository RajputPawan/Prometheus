The workaround we rolled out yesterday is not necessary anymore and will therefore be rolled back today.

The workaround caused issues when people where not in VPN and therefore we decided to rollback that change as fast as possible.

After that change was applied to your system you still need either to reboot or restart your px-proxy user service:

```bash
systemctl --user restart px-proxy
```
