We are pleased to annouce that (some) Notebooks can once again be delivered with
a ready Ubuntu installation in Engineering:

[Bundle Notebook Engineering Ubuntu (20092415)](
https://itshop.app.corpintra.net/itshop/shop/services/detail/3712077250/1003099)

Check the above link for the models currently offered in this bundle.

For a long time, the only way to have Ubuntu on a DaaS ITShop device was to
order it as a standard Windows client and then order
[BUNDLE WANDLUNG BESTEHENDER CLIENT UBUNTU (QEV111AHWIP8)](
https://itshop.app.corpintra.net/itshop/shop/services/detail/1092706851/1003099)
as an accessory to start the conversion process. For the models that are part of
the new bundle, this is not necessary anymore.
