Dear Ubuntu User,
```
As per [1][2], the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver) operating system is 
nearing its End of Standard Support date.
As of April 30, 2023, Canonical, as the operating system vendor, will close 
the hardware and maintenance update window for this OS version and only offer 
support under the Extended Security Maintenance (ESM) paid subscription

Ubuntu Operations team announced the availability of a self-help and assisted 
20.04 (focal fossa) upgrade on July 02, 2021 and started to phase out the 
18.04 version since early 2022


=======================================================================
Starting 3.10.2022, Ubuntu Operations team will end all software 
support for Ubuntu 18.04 and only provide limited assistance related 
to system upgrade

Users are therefore encouraged to upgrade their operating system to 
Ubuntu 20.04 or Ubuntu 22.04 (currently in beta) until 30.9.2022

All machines not migrated until 31.10.2022 will be disabled with 
access rights to the system revoked.
=======================================================================


How to upgrade your Ubuntu system

#1 Use the self-service tool on your device by executing
$ reinstall-os.sh
Script is located under /usr/local/bin/reinstall-os.sh
Upgrade process to version 20.04 is documented at 
https://pages.git.daimler.com/ubunturd/ubuntudoc/reinstall-os.html

#2 Arrange an appointment with the Onsite or Ubuntu Team


Please note:

! The upgrade process will delete all data on your system (including home 
directories). Please perform a backup of your data to a mounted share or an 
external device before triggering the upgrade.

! It is mandatory that you are connected to the Mercedes-Benz RD Network with
an Ethernet cable and not over a VPN or Wifi. The Ethernet-Connection must 
either be established with the onboard Ethernet card or with the original 
Vendor Docking station (Dell/Lenovo).

! The process will take cca 2 hours to complete

! Please be aware that we can not guarantee that any 3rd party software 
which is not certified and works with Ubuntu 18.04 is also functional with 
Ubuntu 20.04. or Ubuntu 22.04
