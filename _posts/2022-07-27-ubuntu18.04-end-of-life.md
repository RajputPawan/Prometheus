The Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver) operating system is nearing its End of Standard Support date

As of April 30, 2023, Canonical, as the operating system vendor, will close the hardware and maintenance update window for this OS version and only offer support under the Extended Security Maintenance (ESM) paid subscription

Ubuntu Operations team announced the availability of a self-help and assisted 20.04 (focal fossa) upgrade on July 02, 2021 and started to phase out the 18.04 version since early 2022
