__After a long wait, our Ubuntu Linux clients finally also offer the
possibility to use personal corporate certificates for email and document
signing!__

See our documentation on how to set up your certificates:

* [Install certificates](/ubunturd/ubuntudoc/cma.html)
* [Set up GNOME Evolution](/ubunturd/ubuntudoc/evolution.html) if you are not
  using it yet
